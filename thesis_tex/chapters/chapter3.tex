Think about the questions you want to answer first:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First model: the impact of previous year decarbonization rate on next-year decarbonization rate and year. Then add id as a random effect and show it improves the model.
    \item Second model: adding sector and showing it's significnat: key finding: sector is significant. Then using sector as a random effect.
    \item Third model: adding continent and showing it's significant: key finding: continent is significant. Then using continent as a random effect.
    \item This is our baseline framework: from here we will be able to determine what drives decarbonization rates the most and which CDP metric should we use to score firms.
    \item Do sector play an important role in driving next-year decarbonziation rates? All else being equal, does knowing the sector of a country help us predict the next-year decarbonization rate? This is going to justify why we are going to use sector as a random effect. 
    \item Do continents play an important role in driving next-year decarbonziation rates? Using them as a ranodm effect as well
    \item Then throw in Continent/Country as a random effect to see if it improves the model and if it is justified.
    \item Then move to the interesting part: the interaction between year and sector: 
\end{itemize}

Recall that 
\begin{align*} 
   E(E(Y|X)) &= E(Y), \\
    \textrm{Var}(Y) &= E(\textrm{Var}(Y|X)) + \textrm{Var}(E(Y|X)). \\
\end{align*}
