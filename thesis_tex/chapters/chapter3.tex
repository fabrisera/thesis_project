\begin{keytakeaway}
  We present the three primary data sources: the \textbf{CDP Climate Change Response Questionnaire}, the \textbf{Worldscope Fundamental Core Items}, and the \textbf{Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)}. The CDP Climate Survey data contains the response surveys from all companies from 2011 to 2022, the Worldscope database provides detailed standardized financials, and the GICS offers a hierarchical classification system for industries.

% \section{Introduction}

% \noindent The reports can be requested from the CDP website \cite{CDPMain2024}, they available both in PDF and a structured CSV format. The CSV files encompass the responses submitted to the CDP questionnaire, which form the foundation of the predictor and response variables for this thesis. My work is a continuation of the initial data processing that was executed by Climate and Sustainability Impact Lab \cite{HarvardD3Lab2024} and kindly shared with me in the form of various stata files and a repository containg both the raw and processed data, where the multiple sections had been extracted from the survey and aligned across different years. I then imported all the data and further processed it to create the training and tests sets for the following models. 


\section{Overview of Data Sources}

\subsection{Climate Change Response Questionnaire}
The main data source comes from the CDP Climate Survey, it contains the response surveys from all companies from 2011 to 2022. The data was partially cleaned and processed by the Climate and Sustainability Impact Lab \cite{HarvardD3Lab2024} before being shared with me. This comprehensive dataset was provided a repository that includes both raw and processed data in the form of Stata files. Organized by firm-years, each observation in the dataset corresponds to a specific firm in a given year, and is structured in a panel format, having a unique id year pair to uniquely identify each entry. The original dataset contained $34,588$ firm-years across $11$ years. Since the analysis controls for financial and industry-specific predictors, I decided to focus on public companies, which represent $71\%$ of the firm-years in the dataset. Therefore, $9,785$ firm-years were dropped from the analysis because they did not have an ISIN code, which is a unique identifier for public companies. A detailed breakdown of the data cleaning process is provided in the following section \ref{sec:data-cleaning-process-flowchart}.

\subsubsection{Important Considerations on the CDP Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reporting year lag:} The data from a given year corresponds to the financial and operational data from the previous year.This was an important consideration when merging the CDP data with other data sources, such as the Worldscope financial data.
    \item \textbf{Data processing:} The original data processing entailed the extraction of multiple sections from the survey, which were then systematically aligned across different years, ensuring consistency across times and adjusting the format when the questions on the CDP surveyed changed or were slightly modified. It is important to note that the fact that some questions were not asked in some years, and that the questions were not always the same across years, is a significant challenge for the analysis which is specifically focused on forecasting emissions.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Worldscope Fundamental Core Items}
In addition to the CDP Climate Survey data, financial predictors were obtained using the Worldscope database \cite{Worldscope_2} accessed through Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) \cite{WRDS}. Worldscope offers detailed standardized financials, allowing for comparisons of financial information across companies from various industries worldwide. This database boasts a long history, with over 35 years of data for key developed markets dating back to 1980 and more than 25 years for emerging markets. With its extensive coverage of over 100,000 companies in more than 120 countries, including full standardized coverage of over 30 developed and emerging markets and accounting for 99\% of global market capitalization, Worldscope is a comprehensive source for firm-level data. Specifically, I queried the fundamental annuals through Worldscope via WRDS, which provided key global information such as \textit{revenue}, \textit{total assets}, \textit{number of employees}, and \textit{net income}, which I then used as predictors for my analysis \cite{Worldscope_2}. Data was retrieved based on the ISIN code, and resulted in $96\%$ of the firm-years having matching financial data. Of those, $17\%$ had missing values for \textit{at least one} of the selected financial variables, thus the corresponding firm-years were dropped from the data-set. This choice has been made as firms with missing financial data are likely to have total assets less than $1$ million, thus I removed them following a similar criteria enstablished by Serafeim et Al. \cite{incentive-diffusion}.

 \subsection{GICS}
 Accessed through WRDS using Capital IQ, the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) provides the framework for this study's industry analysis. GICS, a collaborative creation by MSCI and S\&P Dow Jones Indices, offers a hierarchical, four-tiered classification system, encompassing Sectors, Industry Groups, Industries, and Sub-Industries. This standard ensures a consistent approach to defining company activities worldwide, crucial for comparative financial analysis. The classification of a company within GICS hinges on its principal business activity, with revenue being a primary determinant. The system also considers earnings and market perception, elements that contribute to the annual refinement of the classifications to mirror evolving market conditions. This research utilizes the 25 industry groups defined within GICS, facilitating a detailed examination of firm-level data against a backdrop of global industry standards \cite{GICS_MSCI}. I queried the GICS data only for the firm-years that had matching financial data, resulting in $19,200$ firm-years with complete financial and GICS data. GICS data was avaialble for $99\%$ of the firm-years that had matching financial data.

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\subsection{The Response Variable: Next-Year Real Decarbonization Rate}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=5in]{figures/ghg_change_real_dist.png}
    \caption{Real Decarbonization Rate}
    \label{fig:next-year-real-decarbonization-rate}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent This is the distribution of our response variable: real decarbonization rate. As we can observe from Figure \ref{fig:next-year-real-decarbonization-rate}, the distribution has three key features (i) has a negative mean and a heavy left tail - that is on average firms are (gladly) reducting real emissions, with varying level of success (ii) the mode is zero - most firms don't change their real emissions over time, that is they do not make any change to their operations or their renewable energy stupply (iii) some frims increase their real emissions, this is a minority but can be observed in the right tail. 

\subsubsection{Why this response variable?}
Out interest is in determining which firms are taking action to reduce their carbon footprint by adopting better technology, and not by operating on other indirect metrics. That is, we overall amount of emissions to go down at a global level, and therefore we are not interested if a firm reduces its emissions by divesting from a subsidiary, or by producing less. Rather, we want to indentify and forecast which firms are taking actions that are going to enable them to emit less and operate more efficiently, and ideally we want those firms to be rewarded. In this regard, real decarboninzation rate only takes into account change in emissions due to process and renewable energy use. 

\subsection{Number of Unique Reporting Firms by Year}
As can be observed from Figure \ref{fig:unique-companies-by-year}, over time the number of unique firms reporting increases. Note that the total number of firms reporting is even higher, this is an illustration of the firms that were selected in the training set. As a requirement, the firm must have been reported for at least three years. Therefore, not only the number of firms reporting to the CDP is increasing, but also the firms who do so over time. I expect this trend to continue, and this is a positive sign since with more firms reporting, more data will be available to build better models and enhance our understanding of emissions' forecasting.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=5in]{figures/unique_companies.png}
  \caption{Number of unique reporting firms by year}
  \label{fig:unique-companies-by-year}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Real Decarbonization Rate Breakdown by Continent}
Figure \ref{fig:emission-breakdown-by-continent} and the relative table show the mean real decarbonization rate by continent across all CDP reporting years from 2011 to 2022. As expected, there is significant class imbalance between continents, with Europe having the most number of firms, followed by North America and Asia. There is a significant difference in the mean decarbonization rate across continents, with Europe having the best mean decarbonoization rate with an average yearly decrease of $-4.94 \%$ and Africa having the worst mean decarbonization rate with an average yearly decrease of $-2.81 \%$. Overall, the data suggests that operating in an environment with more incentives to report and reduce emissions, such as Europe, is associated with a higher mean decarbonization rate. This is consistent with the findings of Downar et al.  \cite{Downar2020The} which shows in a UK-based study that firms with a carbon disclosure mandate reduced emissions by $8\%$ without negatively impacting their financial operating performance. The hypothesis will be further tested in the following sections.

\subsection{Real Decarbonization Rate Breakdown by Sector}

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:mean-decarbonization-rate-by-sector} and the relative table show the mean real decarbonization rate by sector across all CDP reporting years from 2011 to 2022. The data shows that the mean decarbonization rate varies significantly across sectors, with the best mean decarbonization rate in the Software and Services sector, with an average yearly decrease of $-6.67 \%$, and the worst mean decarbonization rate in the Materials sector, with an average yearly decrease of $-2.46\%$. Additionally, there are significant differences in the number of firms across sectors, with the Capital Goods sector having the most number of firms, $475$ and the Household and Personal Products sector having the least number of firms, $43$. Differences in sectors are important to consider, as they can be indicative of the difficulty of decarbonizing a given industry. For example, our data suggests that Transportation and Materials are the sectors with the worst mean decarbonization rates, which is consistent with the findings of Davis et al. \cite{Davis2018Net-zero} which suggest that difficult-to-decarbonize energy services include aviation, long-distance transport, steel and cement production.

\subsection{Real Decarbonization Rate Breakdown by Country}

Figure \ref{fig:mean-decarbonization-rate-by-country} shows the mean real decarbonization rate by country across all CDP reporting years from 2011 to 2022. There are significant differences both in the number of firms and in the mean decarbonization rate across countries. Table~\ref{tab:emission_breakdown_country} shows summary statistics for the worst $10$ performing countries with nonzero mean real decarbonization rates. For a complete list of countries, see appendix table.

\section{Financial Predictors}
Figure \ref{fig:grid} shows the distribution of the financial predictors used in the analysis. This is a list of each predictor along with a brief description of how it was derived:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total Assets \ref{fig:total-assets}}: The total assets of the firm, which is a measure of the firm's size and the scale of its operations. Directly obtained from the Worldscope database and transformed using the natural logarithm $log(1 + \text{Total Assets})$.
    \item \textbf{Market Capitalization \ref{fig:market-capitalization}}: The market capitalization of the firm, which is a measure of the firm's size and the scale of its operations. Directly obtained from the Worldscope database and transformed using the natural logarithm $log(1 + \text{Market Cap})$.
    \item \textbf{Return on Equity \ref{fig:roe}}: The return on equity of the firm, which is a measure of the firm's profitability. Since the return on equity is a percentage which can be negative, the following transformation was used: $log(1 + \frac{\text{ROE}}{100})$.
    \item \textbf{Revenue \ref{fig:revenue}}: The total revenue of the firm, which is a measure of the firm's size and the scale of its operations. Directly obtained from the Worldscope database and transformed using the natural logarithm $log(1 + \text{Revenue})$.
    \item \textbf{Net Income \ref{fig:net-income}}: The net income of the firm, which is a measure of the firm's profitability. Directly obtained from the Worldscope database and transformed using the natural logarithm $log(1 + \text{Net Income})$.
    \item \textbf{Employees \ref{fig:employees}}: The total number of employees of the firm, which is a measure of the firm's size and the scale of its operations. Directly obtained from the Worldscope database and transformed using the natural logarithm $log(1 + \text{Employees})$.
    \item \textbf{Total Assets 1yr Growth \ref{fig:total-assets-1yr-growth}}: The one year growth of the total assets of the firm, which is a measure of the firm's growth. Directly obtained from the Worldscope database and since the growth can be negative, the following transformation was used: $log(1 + \frac{\text{Total Assets 1yr Growth}}{100})$.
    \item \textbf{Employees 1yr Growth \ref{fig:employees-1yr-growth}}: The one year growth of the total number of employees of the firm, which is a measure of the firm's growth. Directly obtained from the Worldscope database and since the growth can be negative, the following transformation was used: $log(1 + \frac{\text{Employees 1yr Growth}}{100})$.
    \item \textbf{Net Income over Assets \ref{fig:net-income}}: The net income of the firm over its total assets, which is a measure of the firm's profitability. The feature was calculated with the following formula $log(1 + \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}})$.
