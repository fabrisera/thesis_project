\section{A Case Study on Two CDP Reports}

\noindent To begin the discussion on exploratory data analysis, I must first address the complexities of emission accounting and reporting within the framework of CDP data, highlighting its distinct nature compared to the more standardized field of financial reporting. That is, despite ongoing improvements, emission reporting still falls short of the robust standards established in financial accounting. I will highlight this by analyzing the 2022 CDP reports from two markedly different companies: General Motors (GM) in the automotive sector and Jet Blue in the airline industry. These reports underscore the highly company-specific nature of emission data, with significant variances stemming from diverse operational practices, especially across different industries. This results in a substantial reliance on text-based and free-form answers within the CDP reports, presenting unique challenges for data analysis. To navigate this complexity, a critical starting point is to analyze the inherent differences in these reports, which will inform and refine our modeling approach. By understanding and accommodating these industry-specific nuances, we aim to develop a more accurate and representative model of emission reporting and reduction strategies as well as identifying potential areas of improvement.
