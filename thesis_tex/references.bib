abstract = {, we show that posterior collapse occurs if and only if the latent variable is non-identifiable in the generative model. Here is the intuition. Consider a dataset X and a latent variable Z. Loosely, a latent variable is non-identifiable (Poirier, 1998) when the likelihood of the generative model p(x | z) does not depend on this latent variable Z, i.e. p(x | z) ∝ f (x) for some function f. Then, by the Bayes rule, its (exact) posterior is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood p(z | x) ∝ p(z) {\textperiodcentered} p(x | z) ∝ p(z) {\textperiodcentered} f (x) ∝ p(z). Therefore, the posterior must be equal to the prior because the likelihood is not dependent on Z. This connection between posterior collapse and non-identifiability implies that posterior collapse is not a phenomenon specific to the use of neural networks or variational inference. Rather, it can occur in classical probabilistic models fitted with exact inference methods. As an example, the latent variables in Gaussian mixture model can be non-identifiable and suffer from posterior collapse when the model has more components than the true data generating model. Figure 1 illustrates such a Gaussian mixture model suffering from posterior collapse even with (near-)exact inference. Moreover, we show that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse for the same reason: the per-data-point latent variable is non-identifiable in VAEs. Connecting posterior collapse to non-identifiability results in a natural solution to mitigating posterior collapse in VAEs: one must make the generative model identifiable. We propose a class of identifiable VAEs, which is as flexible as classical VAEs while also being identifiable. This model class resolves the latent variable non-identifiability by leveraging monotone transport maps (Peyr{\'{e}} et al., 2019; McCann et al., 1995) and parameterizing them with input convex neural networks (Amos et al., 2017; Makkuva et al., 2019). Across four datasets, we show that the identifiable VAEs mitigates posterior collapse; see Section 1 for an example. (The supplementary material includes software that reproduces the studies.) Contributions. We consider posterior collapse as a problem of latent variable non-identifiability. We show that posteriors collapse if and only if the latent variable in non-identifiable. It implies that posterior collapse is neither specific to flexible VAEs nor because of its variational approximation. Rather, it pertains to the structure of the generative model. We then propose a class of flexible and identifiable VAEs and demonstrate that it mitigates posterior collapse across four datasets. Appendix A discusses how these contributions situate among the related works. 2},

@article{BHATT2023100095,
	abstract = {Carbon dioxide emission has emerged as a major concern in the 21st century. The rising global average temperature and its impact on climate change has a major impact on the socioeconomic affairs of the world. This rise, directly causes the melting of the polar ice caps which in turn, brings about many other issues including extinction of polar animals, flooding of coastal regions, exposure to ancient microbial life and bacteria frozen in the snow which pose a risk of many more global pandemics and unseen diseases. An urgent need to control this carbon emission is required. The initial step in this process is to accurately identify the threat levels and milestones. Certain thresholds need to be mapped that express the most critical levels of CO2 such as -- the risk point, point of no return, etc. This is the main issue that this paper aims to address. The paper also aims to suggest some methodologies to deal with the same issue. The flow of the experiment and paper is described in the following lines. Historical data was used to make a prediction for the year in which the earth will hit a particular threshold for carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. This level must not be breached and is essential in the fight against climate change. Next, analysis and data are used to calculate the reduction needed in the emission levels in order to bring back the CO2 concentrations into a safer range. The study concludes that the critical level of CO2 - 500 ppm, will be achieved by the year 2047. This level is considered a point of no return. A reduction rate of 6.37% and reversal rate of 23.38% is required to bring the emissions back to safe levels. The study also concluded that various socioeconomic factors such as population, greenhouse gasses, combustion industries contribute the most to these emissions. The authors recommend that further research be carried out on this problem to ascertain further predictions on the point of no return so that an action plan can be developed accordingly. The authors also recommend that a shift to renewable energy sources be undertaken speedily and that carbon neutrality be a crucial goal of every organization.},

	abstract = {Firms' decisions to prepare and to publish private information are key issues in disclosure research. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) provides a unique setting that allows us to examine the determinants of these two sequential disclosure decisions, first to respond to the CDP questionnaire and second to publish this response. We apply a sequential logit approach to analyze a panel dataset that contains 11,187 firm-year observations across 60 countries from 2006 to 2010. Our results indicate that the determinants of the response decision differ from the determinants of the publication decision. Specifically, the response decision is related to the available financial resources, the existence of a certified environmental management system and the publication of corporate social responsibility reports (preparation costs), whereas the publication decision is associated with the environmental performance and the nature of the competitive environment (proprietary costs). Furthermore, our findings suggest that the voluntary disclosure perspective dominates the legitimacy perspective, explaining the association between environmental performance and the publication decision. However, for carbon-intensive industries, our results indicate that both theoretical perspectives complement each other. Our analysis provides a better understanding of firms' response and publication decisions.},

	abstract = {Although Bayesian analysis has been in use since Laplace, the Bayesian method of model-comparison has only recently been developed in depth. In this paper, the Bayesian approach to regularization and model-comparison is demonstrated by studying the inference problem of interpolating noisy data. The concepts and methods described are quite general and can be applied to many other data modeling problems. Regularizing constants are set by examining their posterior probability distribution. Alternative regularizers (priors) and alternative basis sets are objectively compared by evaluating the evidence for them. ``Occam's razor'' is automatically embodied by this process. The way in which Bayes infers the values of regularizing constants and noise levels has an elegant interpretation in terms of the effective number of parameters determined by the data set. This framework is due to Gull and Skilling.},

Although this framework is fully general, we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that we denote the 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), a model of identical functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art 'support vector machine' (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while offering a number of additional advantages. These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of 'nuisance' parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-'Mercer' kernels). We detail the Bayesian framework and associated learning algorithm for the RVM, and give some illustrative examples of its application along with some comparative benchmarks. We offer some explanation for the exceptional degree of sparsity obtained, and discuss and demonstrate some of the advantageous features, and potential extensions, of Bayesian relevance learning.},

Since it is not obvious how large a time-window of inputs is appropriate, or what preprocessing of inputs is best, this can be viewed as a regression problem in which there are many possible input variables, some of which may actually be irrelevant to the prediction of the output variable. Because a finite data set will show random correlations between the irrelevant inputs and the output, any conventional neural network (even with regularisation or `weight decay') will not set the coefficients for these junk inputs to zero. Thus the irrelevant variables will hurt the model's performance.},

  abstract={Maintaining low carbon energy transitions is a phenomenon that is critical in curtailing greenhouse emissions. However, such shifts usually warrant incremental capital expenditures, which require an uninterrupted access to financing. Credit ratings are an essential consideration of the financing process. In this paper, we assess the ability of various machine learning models, in order to forecast the credit ratings of eco-friendly firms. For this purpose, we have employed a sample of 355 Eurozone firms that are ranked on the basis of the extent of their climate change score by SDP, between the years spanning from 2010 to 2019. The study uses various machine learning methods, and the findings suggest that classification and regression trees have the most precision for the credit rating predictions. Even when the forecasting was constrained to the investment grades, speculative grades, or default categories, the accuracy remained robust. The results also suggest that a random forest ensemble can be used alongside the regression trees in order to predict default or near default ratings. Given that such firms face dynamic risk exposure towards environmental, ecological, and social factors, these results have important implications that can be taken into consideration when assessing the credit risk of pro-ecological firms.},

Voluntary disclosures such as those based on the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) are being hailed as an effective measure for better climate risk management. We ask whether this expectation is justified. We do so by training ClimateBERT, a deep neural language model fine-tuned based on the language model BERT. In analyzing the disclosures of TCFD-supporting firms, ClimateBERT comes to the sobering conclusion that the firms' TCFD support is mostly cheap talk and that firms cherry-pick to report primarily non-material climate risk information.},

@article{nguyen-ml,
	abstract = {Corporations have come under pressure from investors and other stakeholders to disclose and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Corporate GHG footprints, proxying for transition risk, are dominated by carbon emissions from energy use. Thus the growing attention on the carbon emissions of corporations from, principally, their energy use, motivates firms to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. However, only a subset of corporations disclose their GHG/carbon footprints. This paper uses machine learning to improve the prediction of corporate carbon emissions for risk analyses by investors. We introduce a two-step framework that applies a Meta-Elastic Net learner to combine predictions from multiple base-learners as the best emission prediction approach. It results in an accuracy gain based on mean absolute error of up to 30% as compared with the existing models. We also find that prediction accuracy can be further improved by incorporating additional predictors (energy production/consumption data) and additional firm disclosures in particular sectors and regions. This provides an indication of where policymakers should concentrate their efforts for greater level of disclosure.},

	abstract = {PurposeThe global interest in climate change makes carbon information important for decision-making. This study examines to what extent companies voluntarily disclose and manage greenhouse gas (GHG) information and whether board diversity and industry type explain variations in the level of disclosure and management of GHG information.Design/methodology/approachCross-sectional data analysis is used for the Financial Stock Exchange 350 (UK FTSE 350) in 2017. Disclosure of GHG information is measured using the scores of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), whereas board diversity is measured using gender diversity, board tenure and board skills. The control variables include firm size, leverage, industry type, board meetings, board size, board independence and CEO duality. Ordinal logistic regression (OLR) is used for data analysis.FindingsThe results indicate that representation of female directors in the board of directors positively influences disclosure and management of GHG information. Conversely, a high percentage of directors with a financial and industrial background negatively affects GHG information, while board tenure has no significant effect on GHG information. Concerning the control variables, only firm size and industry type are significant in their relationships to GHG information.Research limitations/implicationsThe main limitation of the study is investigating only few variables of board diversity. Future studies could investigate other variables such as cultural diversity and age diversity. Furthermore, cross-sectional data analysis cannot capture the dynamic casual impact between the determinants of disclosure and management of GHG information. Future studies could use long-term data, which may yield results that are more significant.Originality/valueThe study emphasizes the importance of the role of female directors in ensuring more transparency toward climate change activities. The findings of this study could be of interest to policymakers and stakeholders and could be used to take initiatives to reduce gender bias and increase the percentage of women in the boardroom. It is also likely to be beneficial for investors and stakeholders to evaluate carbon footprint of businesses and to assess the extent to which they meet their environmental responsibility.},

  abstract={We study how the diffusion of decarbonization incentives is related to an organization’s decarbonization rate over time. Decarbonization opportunities and knowledge within a firm are spread across multiple departments and often reside with employees across different hierarchies. We find that diffusing incentives across senior executives, middle managers, and all employees, is correlated with a larger decarbonization rate. Importantly, this association is driven by emissions reductions from real decarbonization activities (e.g., energy efficiency, renewable energy), as opposed to emission reductions from organizational structure (e.g., M&A) or carbon accounting measurement changes. We predict and find that the incentive diffusion is more robustly associated with decarbonization rates where employee alignment on decarbonization strategy might be more challenging, such as in firms with higher geographical dispersion of emissions, in countries without environmental disclosure regulation, and in countries with less public concern about climate change.},

	abstract = {Researchers have suggested that the relationship between the emission of carbon dioxide per capita and the real gross domestic product per capita follows an inverted-U-shaped (so-called environmental Kuznets) curve. Studies have generally used polynomial regression (quadratic or cubic form) to investigate this relationship. It has been recognised that polynomials are not that flexible and that, by choosing the degree of the polynomial, researchers make a priori assumptions. In this paper, we investigate the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis using a flexible approach from additive mixed models. Such models are well-suited to handle nonlinear covariate effects flexibly and to simultaneously deal with temporal error structure. We consider the following countries: Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Our results show the existence of the classic environmental Kuznets curve for France and Switzerland, and of a nonlinear (increasing) relationship for Australia, Italy and Spain. For Austria, the evidence reveals a weak N-shaped relationship. New nonlinear shapes are found for Finland (inverted-L-shape relationship), Canada (a special case of the inverted-L-shape relationship), and Denmark (M-shape relationship). Our findings are complemented by the calculation of the elasticity of the carbon dioxide emission per capita as a percentage of each level of real gross domestic product per capita.},

That is why some prediction methods are required to estimate the magnitude of infected cases and masses of studies on distinct methods of forecasting are represented so far. In this study, we proposed a hybrid machine learning model that is not only predicted with good accuracy but also takes care of uncertainty of predictions. The model is formulated using Bayesian Ridge Regression hybridized with an n-degree Polynomial and uses probabilistic distribution to estimate the value of the dependent variable instead of using traditional methods. This is a completely mathematical model in which we have successfully incorporated with prior knowledge and posterior distribution enables us to incorporate more upcoming data without storing previous data. Also, L2 (Ridge) Regularization is used to overcome the problem of overfitting. To justify our results, we have presented case studies of three countries, −the United States, Italy, and Spain. In each of the cases, we fitted the model and estimate the number of possible causes for the upcoming weeks. Our forecast in this study is based on the public datasets provided by John Hopkins University available until 11th May 2020. We are concluding with further evolution and scope of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of fuel consumption and emissions is crucial for assessing the impact of materials and stringent emission control techniques on climate change, particularly in the transportation industry, which accounts for a significant portion of global greenhouse gases and hazardous pollutants emissions. To address these concerns, the government of Canada has collected a large sensor-based dataset containing detailed information on 7384 light-duty vehicles from 2017 to 2021, with the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 40--45% by 2030. To this end, various researchers worldwide have developed vehicle emissions and consumption models to comply with these targets and achieve the Canadian government's ambitious objectives. In this work, we propose the development of boosting and other regression models to predict carbon dioxide emissions for light-duty vehicle designs, with the aim of creating ensemble learning models that leverage vehicle specifications to forecast emissions. Our proposed boosting model is capable of accurately predicting CO2 emissions, even with only one car attribute as input. Moreover, our regression models, in conjunction with the boosting algorithm, can effectively make predictions from various vehicle inputs. Our proposed technique, categorical boosting (Catboost), provides critical insights into transportation-generated air pollution, offering valuable recommendations for both vehicle users and manufacturers. Importantly, Catboost performs data processing in less time and with less memory than other algorithms proposed in the literature. Future research efforts should focus on developing higher performance models and expanding datasets to further improve the accuracy of predictions.},

	abstract = {To lower the carbon dioxide and other emissions from a single cylinder common rail direct injection (CRDI) engine, it is important to investigate the combinations of several methods. Lemon peel oil (LPO) and camphor oil (CMO), which are low carbon content biofuels, are the methods that are used and are induced by hydrogen in the intake manifold and zeolite-based after-treatment system. At full load, the injection of hydrogen decreased CO2 and smoke emissions by 39.7% and 49%, respectively. Even though the NO emission increases with hydrogen induction, it was decreased with zeolite after-treatment system. Predictions can be made using machine learning techniques, which will reduce the amount of time and money needed for engine trials. This work focuses on the prediction of engine emissions like CO2, Nitrogen Oxides (NO), Smoke, Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Hydrocarbons (HC) using the ensemble learning techniques. The predictions are made using the ensemble learning methods like Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM), CatBoost, and Random Forest (RF). The CatBoost model has produced high accuracy predictions which was followed by XGBoost, RF and LightGBM models. The predicted and actual values are compared each other and the performance of the algorithms were analysed using the evaluation metrics like R-Square(R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).},
