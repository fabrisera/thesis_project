abstract = {, we show that posterior collapse occurs if and only if the latent variable is non-identifiable in the generative model. Here is the intuition. Consider a dataset X and a latent variable Z. Loosely, a latent variable is non-identifiable (Poirier, 1998) when the likelihood of the generative model p(x | z) does not depend on this latent variable Z, i.e. p(x | z) ∝ f (x) for some function f. Then, by the Bayes rule, its (exact) posterior is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood p(z | x) ∝ p(z) {\textperiodcentered} p(x | z) ∝ p(z) {\textperiodcentered} f (x) ∝ p(z). Therefore, the posterior must be equal to the prior because the likelihood is not dependent on Z. This connection between posterior collapse and non-identifiability implies that posterior collapse is not a phenomenon specific to the use of neural networks or variational inference. Rather, it can occur in classical probabilistic models fitted with exact inference methods. As an example, the latent variables in Gaussian mixture model can be non-identifiable and suffer from posterior collapse when the model has more components than the true data generating model. Figure 1 illustrates such a Gaussian mixture model suffering from posterior collapse even with (near-)exact inference. Moreover, we show that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse for the same reason: the per-data-point latent variable is non-identifiable in VAEs. Connecting posterior collapse to non-identifiability results in a natural solution to mitigating posterior collapse in VAEs: one must make the generative model identifiable. We propose a class of identifiable VAEs, which is as flexible as classical VAEs while also being identifiable. This model class resolves the latent variable non-identifiability by leveraging monotone transport maps (Peyr{\'{e}} et al., 2019; McCann et al., 1995) and parameterizing them with input convex neural networks (Amos et al., 2017; Makkuva et al., 2019). Across four datasets, we show that the identifiable VAEs mitigates posterior collapse; see Section 1 for an example. (The supplementary material includes software that reproduces the studies.) Contributions. We consider posterior collapse as a problem of latent variable non-identifiability. We show that posteriors collapse if and only if the latent variable in non-identifiable. It implies that posterior collapse is neither specific to flexible VAEs nor because of its variational approximation. Rather, it pertains to the structure of the generative model. We then propose a class of flexible and identifiable VAEs and demonstrate that it mitigates posterior collapse across four datasets. Appendix A discusses how these contributions situate among the related works. 2},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide emission has emerged as a major concern in the 21st century. The rising global average temperature and its impact on climate change has a major impact on the socioeconomic affairs of the world. This rise, directly causes the melting of the polar ice caps which in turn, brings about many other issues including extinction of polar animals, flooding of coastal regions, exposure to ancient microbial life and bacteria frozen in the snow which pose a risk of many more global pandemics and unseen diseases. An urgent need to control this carbon emission is required. The initial step in this process is to accurately identify the threat levels and milestones. Certain thresholds need to be mapped that express the most critical levels of CO2 such as -- the risk point, point of no return, etc. This is the main issue that this paper aims to address. The paper also aims to suggest some methodologies to deal with the same issue. The flow of the experiment and paper is described in the following lines. Historical data was used to make a prediction for the year in which the earth will hit a particular threshold for carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. This level must not be breached and is essential in the fight against climate change. Next, analysis and data are used to calculate the reduction needed in the emission levels in order to bring back the CO2 concentrations into a safer range. The study concludes that the critical level of CO2 - 500 ppm, will be achieved by the year 2047. This level is considered a point of no return. A reduction rate of 6.37% and reversal rate of 23.38% is required to bring the emissions back to safe levels. The study also concluded that various socioeconomic factors such as population, greenhouse gasses, combustion industries contribute the most to these emissions. The authors recommend that further research be carried out on this problem to ascertain further predictions on the point of no return so that an action plan can be developed accordingly. The authors also recommend that a shift to renewable energy sources be undertaken speedily and that carbon neutrality be a crucial goal of every organization.},

@article{OTT201714,
	abstract = {Firms' decisions to prepare and to publish private information are key issues in disclosure research. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) provides a unique setting that allows us to examine the determinants of these two sequential disclosure decisions, first to respond to the CDP questionnaire and second to publish this response. We apply a sequential logit approach to analyze a panel dataset that contains 11,187 firm-year observations across 60 countries from 2006 to 2010. Our results indicate that the determinants of the response decision differ from the determinants of the publication decision. Specifically, the response decision is related to the available financial resources, the existence of a certified environmental management system and the publication of corporate social responsibility reports (preparation costs), whereas the publication decision is associated with the environmental performance and the nature of the competitive environment (proprietary costs). Furthermore, our findings suggest that the voluntary disclosure perspective dominates the legitimacy perspective, explaining the association between environmental performance and the publication decision. However, for carbon-intensive industries, our results indicate that both theoretical perspectives complement each other. Our analysis provides a better understanding of firms' response and publication decisions.},
